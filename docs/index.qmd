# Rate Stabilizing Toolbox (RSTbx) <img src="photos/general/logo.png" width = "175" height = "200" align="right" />

Generate reliable, local-level age-standardized measures of chronic disease within ArcGIS Pro.

Want to explore additional Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) models? Check
out the [RSTr package](https://github.com/CEHI-code-repos/RSTr).

## Set up

1.  Download the [latest release](https://github.com/CEHI-code-repos/RateStabilizingToolbox/releases/latest)'s zip file
2.  Unzip the zip file
3.  Open ArcGIS Pro. Create a new Map Project. Within the Catalog Pane,
    right click on thse Toolboxes and Add Toolbox.

## Tools

The RSTbx was designed to be a comprehensive suite of tools that 
allow you to easily generate small area estimates based off of 
complete data (e.g. not survey data). These tools were designed to
work in sequential order (See flowchart below).

### Census Data Retriever (CDR)

Retrieving data from the Census can be hard. The CDR aims to simplify
that process by doing it for you! Simply specify the survey/census
of interest and the geographic unit and the CDR will generate a 
(optionally, age-stratified) total population table. The CDR can also
optionally download Census TIGER or cartographic boundaries.

### Individual Data Processing (IDP)

It is often the case that your data is collected at the individual
level. These data will be need to be aggregated to the region (and age
group, for age standardized rates) for rate calculations within the Rate
Stabilizing Tool. This tool was developed to make that process easier!

### Rate Stabilizing Tool (RST)

The RST offers an easy-to-use interface for the restricted univariate
conditional autoregressive (UCAR) model. With the RST, you can generate
small area estimates, credible intervals for those estimates, and the
maximum credible levels at which these estimates would be considered
reliable.
